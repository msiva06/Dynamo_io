# Dynamo_io
- Created boilerplate UI based code generator for node/npm projects. 
- Integrated with NPMRegistry API to provide typeahead suggestions for the dependencies.
- User provides the Project name, Client side file names, Server side API file names, Data Models file names and node dependencies; Dynamo.IO will create the necessary file structure for the project and the user can download it in Zip file format.
- Aims in reducing the project startup creation time for the developers and increases productivity of the developers to focus on functionality rather than file structure.
